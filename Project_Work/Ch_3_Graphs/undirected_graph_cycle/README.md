# Detect Cycle in Undirected Graph

This was a really difficult problem for me to work on. I had to reference a Geeks for Geeks tutorial to really make any sense of it. I wrote all of the driver program myself, but when it came to the logic of processing the vectors for the adjacency list and tracking which nodes had been visited, that's where I really needed the reference help.

I'll need to keep working on these problems to get better at the data structure processing and making sense of the logic behind it.
